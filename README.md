# sequence-using-circular-array
Implementation of the Sequence ADT using a circular array.

Refer to BigOMethods.png for the Big-O of all methods in isolation, and taking into account array manipulation. Please note that values are not exact, as the circular array often cuts runtimes in half.
Refer GrowthRuntime.png for the amortized runtime of the constant and relative growth algorithms.
